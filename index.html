We speak so much in this class about the way that composition in landscape is highly influential to its thematic reception, the angles, the artist and their choice to display presence or not, and the way that positioning of subject in relativity to a composition changes the way we think about the subject and the environment." , 
        right: "My bedroom sees me nearly every day. My roommate Geri is always nagging me about closing my blinds, because she feels that someone will watch me from across the street while I change or sleep or whatever else takes place in my room. I think this idea of the landscape seeing and judging me is interesting. What if it looked, back? (Which it totally does). The landscape does look back. It is almost making me remove the self centric idea of looking out- because not only do I look out, I imagine who is looking in, and what they might see of me. " },

        right: "Today is the first day I have seen Red in the little bright square that I look through every day. Red on the ends of the leaves has such an inescapable association. It emphasized my already present sadness. It is beautiful today though, it feels like the first real cold day of fall. I had to close all 6 windows, except for the one in the center, the one I am talking about, I feel like if I closed the window the world would suffocate, which is definitely a projection. " },
    { left: "October 15 <br /> The little square is nearly full of red. The redness has become richer and deeper. Since I last wrote I feel much better. Even though the redness of the leaves is temporary and will be replaced by their absence, I am happy to be here for the moment that they are red. And everything will be okay when they fall! ",

        right: "Sadly, Tufts Park is grossly overshadowed by Nathan Tufts Park due to the historical fanstastical significance of Nathan Tufts Park- which was involved with the revolutionary war, a pickle farm, a gun powder factory, and the famous Tufts family. Information on the history of Tufts park on main street is limited. I am pretty sure that my tree is a Red Maple upon researching. Which explains the magnificent colour!" },

The treehouse has a window that aligns with mine. We look at one another every day. The treehouse is all access. That way, I could go into the treehouse and look to my window to see what the park sees of me. I'll see who decides to inhabit it. The treehouse will be a vessel of the park's community. ",

    { left: "November 15 <br />They are beginning to fall. Life’s frenzy is overtaking me! I have not had time to notice them fall. I visited the Arnold Arboretum recently, and saw so many beautiful colorful trees. Their diversity and magnitude put this tree to shame. But what a terrible evil and human thought, to compare the value and beauty of trees.", 
    right: "It is so cold now, and even though all 6 windows are closed it is still cold. These preventative measure are no longer enough and I think will require additive measures quite soon. The room is big and full of things but not always people. I leave it so often and so does my roommate. I feel so guily expecting it to be warm when I get back!" },
    { left: "November 20 <br /> Study and explore your space’s ecological network. What human and non-human animal agents occupy it? How do they use it? What communities do they form?", 
        right: "Often I am greeted in the morning on the weekend by the screams of children at the park. I cut through the off-leash dog park to get back home. I cut around the softball team and the millenial flag football league, I tiptoe past the squirrels and bunnies, and one day a leaf from my special tree fell and tapped my head. Some live here and some play here. It's lovely that the park is simply a place of play. " },
